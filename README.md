# Linked-Objectives
Linked Objectives – The transparent, semantic OKR tool

An open-source OKR tool based on Linked Data and semantic models, enabling data-driven, connected, and transparent goal management.

## Key Features:
* Semantic OKRs – Connect objectives and key results in a structured, meaningful knowledge graph
* Data-Centric & Interoperable – Leverages Linked Data and open standards for seamless integration into existing data landscapes
* Full Transparency – Understand how personal goals contribute to company objectives
* Minimalist & Intuitive – A clean, user-friendly interface makes OKRs accessible, even for beginners

With Linked Objectives, everyone can see, how their goals align with the bigger picture.

## Project Vision:

• The project is designed as an open and collaborative initiative, allowing future students to contribute and extend its capabilities.

• It aims to make OKRs accessible to beginners while serving as a practical application of Linked Data & Semantic Web principles.

• The tool is intended to function as a goal navigation system within a company, helping teams and individuals better understand decision-making processes and see how their contributions align with higher-level objectives and visions.

## Technical Requirements:

• Data Access: All data is accessed via a SPARQL endpoint, ensuring compatibility with Linked Data principles.

• Metamodels: All metamodels are provided as OWL (Web Ontology Language) models.

• User Authentication: Users must be able to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts within the application.

• Test Data: Both user test data and OKR test data are provided in RDF format.

Visual OKR Editing:

The tool should include an interactive diagram editor (e.g., Excalidraw integration) that supports the following features:

• Palette of existing OKRs from the metamodel.

• Drag & Drop functionality for easy visualization of OKRs on a canvas.

• Custom diagrams: Users can create their own visualizations while referencing existing OKRs.

• Automatic rendering of relationships between OKRs.

• Adjustable layout and appearance of connections, while maintaining the integrity of existing relationships.
