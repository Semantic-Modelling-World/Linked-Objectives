# Linked Objectives

**Linked Objectives – The transparent, semantic OKR tool**

An open-source OKR tool based on Linked Data and semantic models, enabling data-driven, connected, and transparent goal management.

---

## Key Features

- **Semantic OKRs** – Connect objectives and key results in a structured, meaningful knowledge graph  
- **Data-Centric & Interoperable** – Leverages Linked Data and open standards for seamless integration into existing data landscapes  
- **Full Transparency** – Understand how personal goals contribute to company objectives  
- **Minimalist & Intuitive** – A clean, user-friendly interface makes OKRs accessible, even for beginners

> With Linked Objectives, everyone can see how their goals align with the bigger picture.

## Project Vision

- The project is designed as an open and collaborative initiative, allowing future students and contributors to extend its capabilities.
- It aims to make OKRs accessible to beginners while serving as a practical application of Linked Data and Semantic Web principles.
- The tool functions as a "goal navigation system" within organizations, helping teams and individuals understand decision-making processes and how their contributions align with high-level objectives and vision.

---

## Technical Requirements

- **Data Access**: All data is accessed via a SPARQL endpoint, ensuring compatibility with Linked Data principles.
- **Metamodels**: All metamodels are provided as OWL (Web Ontology Language) models.
- **User Authentication**: Users must be able to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Test Data**: Both user test data and OKR test data are provided in RDF format.

## Visual OKR Editing

The tool includes an interactive diagram editor (e.g., Excalidraw integration) that supports:

- A palette of existing OKRs from the metamodel
- Drag & Drop functionality for intuitive OKR canvas creation
- Custom diagrams referencing existing OKRs
- Automatic rendering of relationships between OKRs
- Adjustable layout and appearance of connections while maintaining logical integrity
